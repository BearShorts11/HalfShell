Hello Reader, if you are seeing this and wondering what the heck is this then allow me welcome you to
the music debugger scene!

In order to change music: 
1. Make sure the scene is not playing
2. Select the Main Camera, then find the Music Manager script component
3. You should see a field called Music To Play, click the looking glass icon and select any event under Music
4. Play the scene and see that it is now playing a different music

This is a scene quickly put together to test out any music events that are structured for Half-Shell!
While Play and Stop are straight forward buttons, Music Stage ID is what state the music is in.
Depending on the value selected, the music can change. Keyword "can", this depends on how 
the composer makes the music respond to the parameter value.

All of this may be subject to change as the development continues.
